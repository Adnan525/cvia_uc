importance of horizon line : break down the image or segment the image
vertical lines always stay vertical and parallel to each other
perspective effets happen to parallel lines only.
cons for colour, tells us spatial acuity, gives us fine details.
image processing : ther will be input and output
analysis : measurement, e.g. mean
understanding : output with high level description

point operations and neighbourhood operations
point transformations : input -> ooutput, brighter +n to all pixels (0 memory operation)
a is related to mean contrast, b is related to brightness. gain and bias control contrast and brightness respectively.
darken image : -n, contrast : lower divide, higher multiply.
lowering the contrrast is not same as darkening the image even though it has some sort of darkening.
invert or negative : subtract each pixel value from 255, (255 - x)
non-linear raise contrast : divide by 2, pow 2 * 255

neighbourhood operations: looking at a group of pixels, 8 neightbourhood most common
neighbourhood window or filter or kernel
smoothing: filter needs to add up to 1, so brightness stays same
weighted smooting filter : 
mean filtering causes blurring
